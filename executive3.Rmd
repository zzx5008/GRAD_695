## Introduction
My research question is which industry has higher income.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(readxl)
income <- read_excel("C:/Users/rebec_000/Desktop/2018Spring/GRAD_695/income.xlsx", 
    col_types = c("text", "text", "numeric", 
        "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "numeric", "numeric"))
income_valid <- na.omit(income)
summary(income_valid)

tapply(income_valid$All_workers, income_valid$Industry, mean)

```

## Conclusion
Healthcare support industry has highest average income. This dataset is not very good for regression model development. The correlation between variables is too high.
